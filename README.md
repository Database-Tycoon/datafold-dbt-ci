# About this project
This repo demonstrates how you can build your first CI pipeline with GitHub Actions for a simple dbt project.

## What's in this repo?
It uses [seeds](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/seeds) that includes fake raw data from a fictional app, via dbt lab's [jaffle shop test project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop). You can also download the data directly [from here](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop/tree/main/seeds).

The best way to learn how to create your first GitHub Actions workflow is to fork this repository and follow our tutorial (link to be added).
